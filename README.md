Practicing mapping and reducing

## Data set
I have used Car buyers data set, this data set contains different Manufacturer , model , price and different specifications of cars.

## Analysis
I have used mapping to process the data and have considered two columns Manufacturer and Total cars sold columns to display the data in output file. Here by using mapping technique I have displayed the count of different Manufacturer in the second output file.
